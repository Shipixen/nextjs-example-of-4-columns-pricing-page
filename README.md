#### Example of 4-columns pricing page

## How to add a 4-column pricing page

Add a new tier `data/config/pricingData.tsx`

```tsx
// ...

export const pricingTiers: PricingTier[] = [
  // ...add a new pricing tier
  {
    name: 'Pro Max',
    id: '2',
    href: '/subscribe',
    price: { '1': '$4.99', '2': '$59.99' },
    discountPrice: { '1': '', '2': '' },
    description: `Add some more power and flexibility.`,
    features: [
      `All in the pro plan plus`,
      `File versioning`,
      `Advanced user permissions`,
    ],
    featured: false,
    highlighted: true,
    soldOut: false,
    cta: `Get started`,
  },
  // ...
];
```

Handle the 4-tier layout in `app/pricing/page.tsx`. Add a new condition for the 4-column layout: `tiers.length === 4 ? 'lg:grid-cols-2 xl:grid-cols-4' : ''`.

```tsx
// ...
    <div
      className={cn(
        'isolate mx-auto mt-4 mb-28 grid max-w-md grid-cols-1 gap-8 lg:mx-0 lg:max-w-none',
        tiers.length === 2 ? 'lg:grid-cols-2' : '',
        tiers.length === 3 ? 'lg:grid-cols-3' : '',
        tiers.length === 4 ? 'lg:grid-cols-2 xl:grid-cols-4' : '',
      )}
    >
// ...
```
